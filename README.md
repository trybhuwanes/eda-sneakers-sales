This project aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sneaker sales dataset consisting of 500 records and 22 features. The dataset includes detailed attributes such as product name, production and sales figures, damage rates, pricing, release types, sales dates, performance scores, and estimated revenue.

The goal is to uncover actionable insights regarding inventory efficiency, product quality, customer preferences, and revenue patterns to support strategic decision-making in the sneaker business.

- Analyze unsold inventory patterns to identify overproduced products or low-demand models.
- Evaluate product quality by inspecting damage rates and performance scores.
- Understand consumer behavior based on gender preferences and sell-through rates.
- Assess revenue trends over years and across different edition types.
